## Youtube plus
------------

The YouTube Plus (youtube_plus) module imports Youtube video information as nodes
in order to create video list on your site. It also allows you to configure and
import multiple YouTube channel's and playlist's which result in the
possibility to segregate content.

Provides a drush command to execute import/rollback contents by channel or in
bulk. Also allows user to run it manually on the configuration page for
each channel.
